# GroupProject
A group project for all members of CRGS Computing Society to contribute to.

Project not decided yet - options are:
* Server-based game?
	* This would be good as we can "test" it in the club - once it's started!
	* Would be very easy for a team to work on different parts
* Some sort of utility?
	* Possibly useful for the school or ourselves.
	* Opportunity for selling if it is good enough.
	* Sixth formers last year had a project like this called "Bane"

Anyone can join - just ask!
Anyone interested in a crash course in C++, again just ask.

# BANNED
* Visual Basic
* Do not confuse Java and Javascript
* Beware the NaN Kraken
* DO NOT CHANGE YOUR COMPILER OPTIONS! ~~(unless you REALLY, REALLY know what you're doing -- no -Ofast for you!)~~

(I now have SO MANY commits! I feel important! ~Abel)
