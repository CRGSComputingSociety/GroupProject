# GroupProject
A group project for all members of CRGS Computing Society to contribute to.

Project not decided yet - options are:
* Server-based game?
	* This would be good as we can "test" it in the club - once it's started!
	* Would be very easy for a team to work on different parts
* Some sort of utility?
	* Possibly useful for the school or ourselves.
	* Opportunity for selling if it is good enough.
	* Sixth formers last year had a project like this called "Bane"

Anyone can join - just ask!
Anyone interested in a crash course in C++, again just ask.

# BANNED
* Visual Basic
* Scratch
* Uncommented code, you imbecile.

# GENERAL ADVICE
* Do not confuse Java and Javascript
* Beware the NaN Kraken
* DO NOT CHANGE YOUR COMPILER OPTIONS! ~~(unless you REALLY, REALLY know what you're doing -- no -Ofast for you! (unless you're using visual studio compiler inwhich case -Ox is fine :D))~~

# GIT HELP
When you're all set up (ask Abel or Oli if you need some help with that), you will only need a few commands:
* git commit -am "Message"
	* This is used to save all your changes - please use a descriptive message so we can track changes!
* git pull
	* You use this after a commit to make sure your local code is up to date with everyone else's changes.
* git push
	* This transmits all your commits to the main branch, now everyone will get your code when they use pull.

There are many others, but you probably won't need them. Yeah, everybody just commit to the main branch. I'm sure that'll work out fine :3

(I now have SO MANY commits! I feel important! ~Abel)
